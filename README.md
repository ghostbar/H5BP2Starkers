# H5BP2Starkers

## What's this?
This is a project for integrating HTML5 Boilerplate with Starkers, a barebones WordPress theme.

The idea is being able to use the build script from H5BP to build and deploy WordPress themes.

## License
Since H5BP is distributed under the Unlicense and Starkers under the GPL-2, the best is to leave this with a MIT-license.
